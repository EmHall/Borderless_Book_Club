                    <p class="subtitle">Madonna in a Fur Coat - Sabahattin Ali</p>
                    <p>The best-selling Turkish classic of love and longing in a changing world, available in English for the first time. 'It is, perhaps, easier to dismiss a man whose face gives no indication of an inner life. And what a pity that is: a dash of curiosity is all it takes to stumble upon treasures we never expected.' A shy young man leaves his home in rural Turkey to learn a trade in 1920s Berlin. The city's crowded streets, thriving arts scene, passionate politics and seedy cabarets provide the backdrop for a chance meeting with a woman, which will haunt him for the rest of his life. Emotionally powerful, intensely atmospheric and touchingly profound, Madonna in a Fur Coat is an unforgettable novel about new beginnings and the unfathomable nature of the human soul. "Passionate but clear...Ali's success [is in ] his ability to describe the emergence of a feeling, seemingly straightforward from the outside but swinging back and forth between opposite extremes at its core, revealing the tensions that accompanies such rise and fall." (Atilla Ozkirimli, writer and literary historian).</p>

She was my Kadriye Nene, my raven. Of course, by the time I came to know her, my Nene’s hair had been gray for many years, but in the photos taken with my grandfather, her hair and her eyes gleamed, black as the bird itself..."</p>

                    <p> I</p>
                    <p> Living is no laughing matter:<br>
                        you must live with great seriousness<br>
                        like a squirrel, for example—<br>
                        I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,<br>
                        I mean living must be your whole occupation.<br>
                        Living is no laughing matter:<br>
                        you must take it seriously,<br>
                        so much so and to such a degree<br>
                        that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,<br>
                        your back to the wall,<br>
                        or else in a laboratory<br>
                        in your white coat and safety glasses,<br>
                        you can die for people—<br>
                        even for people whose faces you've never seen,<br>
                        even though you know living<br>
                        is the most real, the most beautiful thing.<br>
                        I mean, you must take living so seriously<br>
                        that even at seventy, for example, you'll plant olive trees—<br>
                        and not for your children, either,<br>
                        but because although you fear death you don't believe it,<br>
                        because living, I mean, weighs heavier.<br>
                    <p> II</p>
                    <p> Let's say we're seriously ill, need surgery—<br>
                        which is to say we might not get up<br>
                        from the white table.<br>
                        Even though it's impossible not to feel sad<br>
                        about going a little too soon,<br>
                        we'll still laugh at the jokes being told,<br>
                        we'll look out the window to see if it's raining,<br>
                        or still wait anxiously<br>
                        for the latest newscast... <br>
                        Let's say we're at the front—<br>
                        for something worth fighting for, say.<br>
                        There, in the first offensive, on that very day,<br>
                        we might fall on our face, dead.<br>
                        We'll know this with a curious anger,<br>
                        but we'll still worry ourselves to death<br>
                        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.<br>
                        Let's say we're in prison<br>
                        and close to fifty,<br>
                        and we have eighteen more years, say,<br>
                        before the iron doors will open.<br>
                         We'll still live with the outside,<br>
                        with its people and animals, struggle and wind—<br>
                        I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.<br>
                        I mean, however and wherever we are,<br>
                        we must live as if we will never die.
                    </p>
                    <p> III</p>
                    <p> This earth will grow cold,<br>
                        a star among stars<br>
                        and one of the smallest,<br>
                        a gilded mote on blue velvet—<br>
	                    I mean this, our great earth.<br>
                        This earth will grow cold one day,<br>
                        not like a block of ice<br>
                        or a dead cloud even <br>
                        but like an empty walnut it will roll along<br>
	                    in pitch-black space...<br>
                        You must grieve for this right now<br>
                        —you have to feel this sorrow now—<br>
                        for the world must be loved this much<br>
                        if you're going to say "I lived"...<br>

                    <p>Memed grows up a serf to a vicious overlord on the thistle-clad plains of Turkey's Taurus region. When his plan to escape is dashed, and the young woman he loves murdered, Memed makes for the mountains to become an outlaw. Before long he has transformed from a young rebel to an infamous bandit, the scourge of corrupt oppressors and hero to the poor. With vividness and simplicity, Kemal's classic novel evokes the fierce beauty of his country and the struggles of its oppressed people.</p>
