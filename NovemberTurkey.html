                    <p>Since the middle of the 20th century, Turkish literature has evolved rapidly, in concert with the fall of the Ottoman Empire and foundation of the Turkish Republic. The literature of the new republic had its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the Latin alphabet to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. This along with changes to the education system led to widespread literacy in the country so that in the 1950s, Turkish authors started to write in the tone of their western contemporaries bringing a new sense of literature to the country.</p>
                    <p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, the most vital debate of Turkish literature has been between the proponents of art for art's sake and the advocates of commitment to realism and social causes. In 1921 Mustafa Kemal proclaimed that the 19 year old Nazim Hikmet, already a famous poet, would embrace the communist ideology and influence the course of modern Turkish literature, particularly poetry, more profoundly than anyone else.</p>
                    <p>Since 1950, there has been massive output, in all genres, depicting the plight of the lumpen proletariat - but surrealism, neo-symbolism, theater of the absurd, stream of consciousness, hermeticism, black comedy and so on have also flourished.</p>

                    <p>Sabahattin Ali (February 25, 1907 – April 2, 1948) was a Turkish novelist, short-story writer, poet, and journalist. His short novel "Madonna in A Fur Coat" (1943) is considered one of the best novellas in Turkish literature. It first appeared on the pages of daily Hakikat, 1941–42, in 48 instalments. With this novel, Sabahattin Ali became one of the two Turkish novelists whose works made it to the Penguin Classics, the other being Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar's "The Time Regulation Institute".</p>
                    <p>In “Madonna in a Fur Coat”, A shy young man leaves his home in rural Turkey to learn a trade in 1920s Berlin. The city's crowded streets, thriving arts scene, passionate politics and seedy cabarets provide the backdrop for a chance meeting with a woman, which will haunt him for the rest of his life.</p>

                    Nâzım Hikmet (15 January 1902 – 3 June 1963) was a Turkish poet, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, director and memoirist. Described as a "romantic communist" and "romantic revolutionary", he was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile. His poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages.</p>
                    <p> I</p>
                    <p> Living is no laughing matter:<br>
                        you must live with great seriousness<br>
                        like a squirrel, for example—<br>
                        I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,<br>
                        I mean living must be your whole occupation.<br>
                        Living is no laughing matter:<br>
                        you must take it seriously,<br>
                        so much so and to such a degree<br>
                        that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,<br>
                        your back to the wall,<br>
                        or else in a laboratory<br>
                        in your white coat and safety glasses,<br>
                        you can die for people—<br>
                        even for people whose faces you've never seen,<br>
                        even though you know living<br>
                        is the most real, the most beautiful thing.<br>
                        I mean, you must take living so seriously<br>
                        that even at seventy, for example, you'll plant olive trees—<br>
                        and not for your children, either,<br>
                        but because although you fear death you don't believe it,<br>
                        because living, I mean, weighs heavier.<br>
                    <p> II</p>
                    <p> Let's say we're seriously ill, need surgery—<br>
                        which is to say we might not get up<br>
                        from the white table.<br>
                        Even though it's impossible not to feel sad<br>
                        about going a little too soon,<br>
                        we'll still laugh at the jokes being told,<br>
                        we'll look out the window to see if it's raining,<br>
                        or still wait anxiously<br>
                        for the latest newscast... <br>
                        Let's say we're at the front—<br>
                        for something worth fighting for, say.<br>
                        There, in the first offensive, on that very day,<br>
                        we might fall on our face, dead.<br>
                        We'll know this with a curious anger,<br>
                        but we'll still worry ourselves to death<br>
                        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.<br>
                        Let's say we're in prison<br>
                        and close to fifty,<br>
                        and we have eighteen more years, say,<br>
                        before the iron doors will open.<br>
                         We'll still live with the outside,<br>
                        with its people and animals, struggle and wind—<br>
                        I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.<br>
                        I mean, however and wherever we are,<br>
                        we must live as if we will never die.
                    </p>
                    <p> III</p>
                    <p> This earth will grow cold,<br>

                        and one of the smallest,<br>
                        a gilded mote on blue velvet—<br>
	                    I mean this, our great earth.<br>
                        This earth will grow cold one day,<br>
                        not like a block of ice<br>
                        or a dead cloud even <br>
                        but like an empty walnut it will roll along<br>
	                    in pitch-black space...<br>
                        You must grieve for this right now<br>
                        —you have to feel this sorrow now—<br>
                        for the world must be loved this much<br>
                        if you're going to say "I lived"...<br>

                    <p class="subtitle">Memed, My Hawk, Yashar Kemal</p>        
                    <p>Yaşar Kemal (born 6 October 1923 – 28 February 2015) was a Kurdish writer and human rights activist, and one of Turkey's leading writers. He received 38 awards during his lifetime and was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature for Memed, My Hawk. An outspoken intellectual, he did not hesitate to speak about sensitive issues, especially those concerning the oppression of the Kurdish people. He was tried in 1995 under anti-terror laws for an article he wrote for Der Spiegel highlighting the Turkish Army's destruction of Kurdish villages during the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. And was released but later received a suspended 20-month jail sentence for another article he wrote criticising racism in Turkey, especially against the Kurds.</p>
                    <p>Memed, My Hawk offers a tantalising glimpse of a forgotten, rural Turkey. Memed grows up a serf to a vicious overlord on the thistle-clad plains of Turkey's Taurus region. With vividness and simplicity, Kemal's classic novel evokes the fierce beauty of his country and the struggles of its people.</p>
