                    <p class="subtitle">Second Person Singular - Sayed Kashua</p>
                    <p>A Palestinian who writes in Hebrew, Sayed Kashua defies classification and breaks through cultural barriers. He communicates, with enormous emotional power and a keen sense of the absurd, the particular alienation and the psychic costs of people struggling to straddle two worlds. Second Person Singular is a deliciously complex psychological mystery and a searing dissection of the individuals that comprise a divided society.</p>
                    <p>Second Person Singular follows two men, a successful Arab criminal attorney and a social worker-turned-artist, whose lives intersect under the most curious of circumstances. The lawyer has a thriving practice in the Jewish part of Jerusalem, a large house, a Mercedes, speaks both Arabic and Hebrew, and is in love with his wife and two young children. In an effort to uphold his image as a sophisticated Israeli Arab, he often makes weekly visits to a local bookstore to pick up popular novels. On one fateful evening, he decides to buy a used copy of Tolstoy's The Kreutzer Sonata, a book his wife once recommended. To his surprise, inside he finds a small white note, a love letter, in Arabic, in her handwriting. I waited for you, but you didn't come. I hope everything's all right. I wanted to thank you for last night. It was wonderful. Call me tomorrow? Consumed with suspicion and jealousy, the lawyer slips into a blind rage over the presumed betrayal. He first considers murder, revenge, then divorce, but when the initial sting of humiliation and hurt dissipates, he decides to hunt for the book's previous owner--a man named Yonatan, a man who is not easy to track down, whose identity is more complex than imagined, and whose life is more closely aligned with his own than expected. In the process of dredging up old ghosts and secrets, the lawyer tears the string that holds all of their lives together.</p>
                    <p>From one of the most important contemporary voices to emerge from the Middle East comes a gripping tale of love and betrayal, honesty and artifice, which asks whether it is possible to truly reinvent ourselves, to shed our old skin and start anew.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Jews in the Land of Israel - Yehuda Amichai</p>
                    <p> We forget where we came from. Our Jewish<br>
                        names from the Exile give us away,<br>
                        bring back the memory of flower and fruit, medieval cities,<br>
                        metals, knights who turned to stone, roses,<br>
                        spices whose scent drifted away, precious stones, lots of red,<br>
                        handicrafts long gone from the world<br>
                        (the hands are gone too).</p>
                        <p>
                        Circumcision does it to us,<br>
                        as in the Bible story of Shechem and the sons of Jacob,<br>
                        so that we go on hurting all our lives.</p>
                        <p>
                        What are we doing, coming back here with this pain?<br>
                        Our longings were drained together with the swamps,<br>
                        the desert blooms for us, and our children are beautiful.<br>
                        Even the wrecks of ships that sank on the way<br>
                        reached this shore,<br>
                        even winds did. Not all the sails.</p>
                        <p>
                        What are we doing<br>
                        in this dark land with its<br>
                        yellow shadows that pierce the eyes?<br>
                        (Every now and then someone says, even after forty<br>
                        or fifty years: "The sun is killing me.")</p>
                        <p>
                        What are we doing with these souls of mist, with these names,<br>
                        with our eyes of forests, with our beautiful children,<br>
                        with our quick blood?</p>
                        <p>     
                        Spilled blood is not the roots of trees<br>
                        but it's the closest thing to roots<br>
                        we have.</p>
