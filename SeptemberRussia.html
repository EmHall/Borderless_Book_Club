                    <p class="title">Russia</p>
                    <p>The Golden Age of Russian Literature spanned 1830-1890. Alexander Pushkin was central to this movement. The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol, then came Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy and then Fyodor Dostoevsky. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov pioneered short stories and plays.</p>
                    <p>The beginning of the 20th century is known as the Silver Age of Russian poetry, with writers such as Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Sergei Yesenin and Boris Pasternak coming to the fore in spite of harsh treatment by the Soviet state. In the 1930s, Socialist realism was encouraged by the state, and its leading figure was Maxim Gorky. Other writers such as short story Nobel Prize-winners Ivan Bunin and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn continued to write in exile.</p>                   
                    <p>The end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature, with few distinct voices. The “Thaw” under Nikita Khruschev (55-64) was supposed to revitalise literature, but prosecutions against writers continued. Among the most discussed authors of the latter half of the century were the playwright Vladimir Sorokin, and the poet Dmitri Prigov.</p>
                    <p>In the 21st century, a new generation of Russian "New Realist" authors has appeared, including Victor Pelevin, Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and Vladimir Sorokin.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">A Hero of Our Time - Mikhail Lermentov</p>
                    <p>Mikhail Lermontov (1814-41) was a Russian Romantic writer and poet. As a young man he was an officer in the guards, and was sent to fight in the Caucasus after insulting the Tsar. His work is heavily influenced by Pushkin, and his dramatic life ended after being shot in a duel.</p>
                    <p>A Hero of Our Time was the first major Russian novel, and was both lauded and reviled on publication. Its Byronic hero, Pechorin, is a beautiful and magnetic but nihilistic young army officer, bored by life and indifferent to his many sexual conquests. In five linked episodes, Lermontov builds up a portrait of a man caught in and expressing the sickness of his times. Chronicling his unforgettable adventures in the Caucasus involving brigands, smugglers, soldiers, rivals, and lovers, this classic tale of alienation influenced Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">How Much Land Does a Man Need? - Leo Tolstoy</p>
                    <p>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852–1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859), and Hadji Murad (1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays. How Much Land Does a Man Need is a short story about greed, charity, life and death.</p>
                    <p>In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly Resurrection (1899).</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Legend on an Unfinished Portrait - Anna Akhmatova 1912</p>
                    <p>Akhmatova, whose real surname was Gorenko, is one of the two greatest women poets in the history of Russian poetry. The daughter of a merchant marine engineer, she spent much of her childhood in Tsarskoye Selo, the village outside St. Petersburg where the Tsar's summer palace was located. The regal nature of her work is perhaps in part attributable to this royal environment. Her first books of poetry, Vecher (Evening) (1912) and Chyotki (Rosary) (1913; reissued eleven times), brought her critical acclaim. From 1910 to 1918 she was married to Nikolay Gumilev.</p>
                    <p>Akhmatova's poetry, with a few exceptions, is distinguished from that of Russia's other preeminent woman poet, Marina Tsvetayeva, by its polished form, classical transparency, and thematic intimacy. She wrote comparatively few poems of a "civic" character. Her poetry has stood the test of time, as evidenced by such works as "Mne golos byl..." (I heard a voice...), which repudiates immigration; the patriotic "Muzhestvo" (Courage), which appeared during World War II; the remarkable "Rekviem" (Requiem); and others.</p>
                    <p>It is revealing that, despite the personal tragedy of her son's arrest and persecution during Stalin's worst purges in 1937-1938, she did not grow bitter but bore her pain with dignity and endurance. At the time of her death Akhmatova was highly acclaimed both at home and abroad. Her funeral was a farewell to an entire literary epoch (more than half a century) of which she was the queen.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing to be sad about.<br>Sadness is a crime, a prison.<br>A strange impression, I have risen<br>From the grey canvas like a sheet.</p>
                    <p>Up-flying arms, with a bad break,<br>Tormented smile – I and the sitter<br>Had to become thus through the bitter<br>Hours of profligate give and take.</p>
                    <p>He willed it that it should be so,<br>With words that were sinister and dead.<br>Fear drove into my lips the red,<br>And into my cheeks it piled the snow.</p>
                    <p>No sin in him. I was his fee.<br>He went, and arranged other limbs,<br>And other draperies. Void of dreams,<br>I lie in mortal lethargy.</p>

                    <p class="title">A Russian Classic</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Eugene Onegin - Aleksandr Pushkin</p>
                    <p>Pushkin is widely considered to be Russia's greatest poet, and his work helped shape the Russian language and literary tradition. His maternal great-grandfather was African-born general Abram Petrovich Gannibal - a fact which is often overlooked. In 1825, Pushkin recited his controversial poem "Ode to Liberty", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, Boris Godunov. Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his brother-in-law, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment, who attempted to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.</p>
                    <p>Set in 1820s Russia, Pushkin's verse novel Eugene Onegin follows the fates of three men and three women. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it contains a large cast of characters and offers the reader many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work.</p>
