                    <h6>The Golden Age of Russian Literature spanned 1830-1890. Alexander Pushkin was central to this movement.
                    The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol, then came Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy and then Fyodor Dostoevsky.
                    In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and plays.
                    <h6>The beginning of the 20th century is known as the Silver Age of Russian poetry, with writers such as Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Sergei Yesenin and Boris Pasternak coming to the fore in spitte of the harsh treatment by the Soviet state.</h6>
                    <h6>In the 1930s, Socialist realism became the predominant trend, and its leading figure was Maxim Gorky. Other writers such as short story Nobel Prize-winners Ivan Bunin and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn continued to write in exile.
                    The Khrushchev Thaw revitalised literature but prosecutions against writers continuted.<h6>
                    <h6>The end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature, with few distinct voices. Among the most discussed authors of this period were Victor Pelevin, who gained popularity with short stories and novels, novelist and playwright Vladimir Sorokin, and the poet Dmitri Prigov.</h6>
                    <h6>In the 21st century, a new generation of Russian "New Realist" authors appeared, including Victor Pelevin, Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and Vladimir Sorokin.</h6>

                    <p class="title">Eugene Onegin, by Aleksandr Pushkin, 1825/p>
                    <p class="text-blurb">Pushkin is widely considered to be Russia's greatest poet, and his work helped shape the Russian language and literary tradition.
                    His maternal great-grandfather was African-born general Abram Petrovich Gannibal.
                    In 1825, Pushkin recited his controversial poem "Ode to Liberty", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.
                    Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his brother-in-law, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment, who attempted to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.</p>
                    <p class="text-blurb">Eugene Onegin is a novel in verse. Almost the entire work is made up of 389 fourteen-line stanzas.
                    The story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin's public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate.
                    The narrator digresses at times, usually to expand on aspects of this social and intellectual world.
                    The peom is admired for the artfulness of its verse narrative as well as for its exploration of life, death, love, ennui, convention, and passion.
                    It is about a woman who professes her love to a young dandy, but whose love is requited later in life.</p>
