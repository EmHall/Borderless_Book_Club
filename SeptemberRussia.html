                    <p>The Golden Age of Russian Literature spanned 1830-1890. Alexander Pushkin was central to this movement.
                    The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol, then came Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy and then Fyodor Dostoevsky.
                    In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and plays.
                    <p>The beginning of the 20th century is known as the Silver Age of Russian poetry, with writers such as Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Sergei Yesenin and Boris Pasternak coming to the fore in spitte of the harsh treatment by the Soviet state. In the 1930s, Socialist realism became the predominant trend, and its leading figure was Maxim Gorky. Other writers such as short story Nobel Prize-winners Ivan Bunin and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn continued to write in exile.                   
                    The Khrushchev Thaw revitalised literature but prosecutions against writers continuted.
                    The end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature, with few distinct voices. Among the most discussed authors of this period were Victor Pelevin, who gained popularity with short stories and novels, novelist and playwright Vladimir Sorokin, and the poet Dmitri Prigov.</p>
                    <p>In the 21st century, a new generation of Russian "New Realist" authors appeared, including Victor Pelevin, Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and Vladimir Sorokin.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">A Hero of Our Time - Mikhail Lermentov</p>
                    <p>Mikhail Lermontov (1814-41) was a Russian Romantic writer and poet. As a young man Lermontov was an officer in the guards, and was sent to fight in the Caucasus after insulting the Tsar. His dramatic life ended after being shot down in a duel.</p>
                    <p>The first major Russian novel, A Hero of Our Time was both lauded and reviled on publication. Its Byronic hero, twenty-five-year-old Pechorin, is a beautiful and magnetic but nihilistic young army officer, bored by life and indifferent to his many sexual conquests. In five linked episodes, Lermontov builds up a portrait of a man caught in and expressing the sickness of his times. Chronicling his unforgettable adventures in the Caucasus involving brigands, smugglers, soldiers, rivals, and lovers, this classic tale of alienation influenced Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov, holding up a mirror not only to Lermontov's time but also to our own.</p>
                    <p>A masterpiece of Russian prose, Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time is translated with an introduction and notes by Natasha Randall, and a foreword by Neil LaBute, author of reasons to be pretty, in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>

                    <p>No sin in him. I was his fee.<br>He went, and arranged other limbs,<br>And other draparies. Void of dreams,<br>I lie in mortal lethargy.</p>

                    <p class="title">A Russian Classic</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">Eugene Onegin - Aleksandr Pushkin</p>
                    <p>Pushkin is widely considered to be Russia's greatest poet, and his work helped shape the Russian language and literary tradition.
                    His maternal great-grandfather was African-born general Abram Petrovich Gannibal.
                    In 1825, Pushkin recited his controversial poem "Ode to Liberty", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.
                    Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his brother-in-law, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment, who attempted to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.</p>
                    <p>Eugene Onegin is the master work of the poet whom Russians regard as the fountainhead of their literature. Set in 1820s Russia, Pushkin's verse novel follows the fates of three men and three women. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it contains a large cast of characters and offers the reader many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work, and this new translation by Stanley Mitchell conveys the literal sense and the poetic music of the original.</p>
